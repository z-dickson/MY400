# Questions from the Lecture?



# Introduction

- **Seminar Goals**:
  - Understand the importance of description in research.
  - Explore key concepts from Holmes et al. (2023): "A Case for Description."
  - Discuss practical implications for research methodology and how the concept is applicable to your research.


# Why Focus on Description?

- Quantitative research involves three inferential postures:
  1. **Description**: "How the world is."
  2. **Causation**: "Why the world is the way it is."
- This seminar emphasizes **description**.




# Defining Description

- **Description**:
  - Answers "who," "what," "when," "where," and "how" questions.
  - Focuses on operationalization, measurement, and sampling.



# Historical Context (Holmes et al., 2023)

- Behavioral revolution emphasized causality and generalization.
- Description became devalued as "merely descriptive."
- Recent efforts revalue description in conceptualization, data management, and policy relevance.



# Contributions of Descriptive Research

- According to Holmes et al. (2023):
  1. **Conceptualization**: Defining and refining key concepts.
  2. **Data Management**: Improving data collection and curation.
  3. **Policy Insights**: Informing decision-making.
  4. **Challenging Biases**: Diversifying perspectives.



# Conceptualization and Coherence

- Description underpins:
  - Defining key terms (e.g., "civil war," "democracy").
  - Standardizing measurements across datasets.
- Example: Discrepancies in measuring civilian fatalities (Broache et al., 2022).



# Policy Relevance and Public Engagement

- Policymakers and media require descriptive insights:
  - Contextualize complex policy issues.
  - Highlight trends and patterns.
- Example: Climate change studies leveraging descriptive statistics to guide decisions.



# Pitfalls of Bad Data Practices

- Potential risks:
  - **Bias**: Measurement errors, sampling issues.
  - **Complex Modeling**: Misleading results from over-specified models.
- Example: Misinterpreting relationships due to partial correlations.






# Class Discussion: Reading Questions

- Based on Holmes et al. (2023):
  - Why is description undervalued in social science?
  - Do you agree that description can deepen conceptualization, improve data practices, and challenge biases?
- What are the contributions and risks of descriptive research.



# Quick Reflection

- Reflect on your research project:
  - Is your project primarily descriptive or causal?
  - Why?

# Paper Discussion

Chetty, R., Jackson, M.O., Kuchler, T., Stroebel, J., Hendren, N., Fluegge, R.B., Gong, S., Gonzalez, F., Grondin, A., Jacob, M. and Johnston, D., 2022. Social capital I: measurement and associations with economic mobility. Nature, 608(7921), pp.108-121.

> Think about the distinct research questions that the authors tackle in this paper. Are the questions descriptive, causal, or some mix of these? Which question-answer pairs that the authors offer do you find most persuasive?






# Recap and Takeaways

- Description and prediction:
  - Essential and complementary.
  - Enable rigorous and impactful social science research.
- Reframe descriptive work as foundational, not secondary.
- Engage critically with methodological decisions.




# Next week - Week 10

- Causation in quantitative/computational research
- Office hours will be on Tuesdays 3-5pm

# Group Exercise: Designing a Study

1. **Choose a research topic**:
   - Example: "Social Media and Mental Health."
2. **Research Question**:
   - Formulate a descriptive question.
3. **Design a Research Approach**:
   - Operationalization, sampling, analysis, risks.
