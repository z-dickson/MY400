# Questions from the Lecture?




# Seminar Overview

- **Topic**: Causal Inference in the Social Sciences
- **Goals**:
  - Understand the potential outcomes framework.
  - Explore the fundamental problem of causal inference.
  - Discuss tools for addressing causation in observational and experimental research.
- **Readings**:
  - Angrist & Pischke (2009): *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*.
  - Hernán (2018): *The C-Word*.
  - Abdelgadir & Fouka (2020): *French Headscarf Ban*


# What is Causal Inference?

- **Definition**: Understanding *the effect* of a treatment or intervention on an outcome.
- **Key Question**: What would have happened in the absence of the treatment?
- **Central Challenge**:
  - The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.
  - We observe only one potential outcome (treated or untreated) for each unit.
    - e.g. the counterfactual is unobservable 
    - scope conditions 


# Potential Outcomes Framework

- For each unit:
  - $[Y_1]$: Outcome if treated.
  - $[Y_0]$: Outcome if untreated.
- **Causal Effect**:
  - $[Y_1 - Y_0]$: Difference in outcomes due to treatment.
- Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference:
  - Only one of $[Y_1]$ or $[Y_0]$ is observed.





# The Experimental Ideal

- **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**:
  - Random assignment of treatment ensures:
    - $[Y_1]$ and $[Y_0]$ are independent of treatment ($D_i \perp [Y_{0i}, Y_{1i}]$).
    - Causal effects are unbiased and consistent.
- **Advantages**:
  - Allows direct estimation of average treatment effects (ATE).
- **Limitations**:
  - Ethical concerns.
  - Feasibility and cost.



# Counterfactual Reasoning

- **Counterfactual**:
  - The outcome that would have occurred under a different treatment state.
- **Example** (Angrist & Pischke):
  - What would wages be for someone who didn’t attend college?
- Counterfactual reasoning underpins causal questions and research design.



# Identification Strategies in Observational Data

- **Goal**: Approximate the experimental ideal.
- **Common Strategies**:
  - Matching.
  - Difference-in-Differences (DiD).
  - Instrumental Variables (IV).
  - Regression Discontinuity (RD).


# Matching

- **Idea**:
  - Match treated and control units on observed covariates.
- **Example**:
  - Effects of a training program on employment outcomes.

# Regression Discontinuity (RD)

- **Idea**:
  - Use a cutoff or threshold to identify causal effects.
- **Example**:
  - Effects of a policy change near a threshold - e.g. school class size.
    - [e.g.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.5.1953)


# Difference-in-Differences (DiD)

- **Idea**:
  - Compare changes over time between treated and control groups.
- **Example**:
  - Effects of a policy change before and after implementation, relative to a feasible control group.
    - [e.g.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268015000245)


# Instrumental Variables (IV)

- **Idea**:
  - Use an instrument to identify causal effects.
- **Example**:
  - Effects of education on earnings using compulsory schooling laws as an instrument.


# Case Study: French Headscarf Ban

- **Research Question**:
  - How did the 2004 French headscarf ban affect Muslim women’s socioeconomic outcomes?
- **Methodology**:
  - Difference-in-Differences:
    - Compare Muslim girls before/after the ban.
    - Use non-Muslim girls as a control group.



# Group Activity 1: Evaluate the French Ban Study

- **Questions**:
  1. What are the main threats to causal inference in this study?
  2. How does the DiD approach address confounding?
  3. What assumptions must hold for the DiD results to be valid?
- **Discuss**:
  - Strengths and limitations of the identification strategy.



# The Role of Assumptions

- Even in experiments:
  - Assumptions about randomization and independence are critical.
- Observational studies require:
  - Clear identification strategies.
  - Robust sensitivity analyses.



# Hernán (2018): Causal Questions Rule

- **Key Insights**:
  - Clearly articulate causal research questions.
  - Avoid hiding causal aims behind associational language.
  - “Research questions determine the method, not vice versa”.



# Group Activity 2: Formulating Causal Questions

1. Using your peers' research question:
   - Identify the causal component.
   - Reframe the question in causal terms.
2. Develop:
   - An ideal (ethical) experiment to answer it.
   - An identification strategy for observational data.
3. Share and critique strategies as a group.



# Summary and Takeaways

- Causal inference is challenging but essential.
- Key principles:
  - Counterfactual reasoning.
  - Experimental ideal and its limitations.
  - Robust identification strategies in observational settings.
- **Further Reading**:
  - MY457: Causal Inference in Observational Studies.




# Questions and Discussion

- **Reflection**:
  - What methods are most relevant to your research?
  - How can these tools improve policy evaluation?
- Open floor for questions and comments.

# The Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

<br>

We want to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) across all units.

- **Example**: 
  - What is the effect of education on earnings?
  - What is the effect of a policy on voter turnout?

<br>

$$E[Y_i|D_i=1] - E[Y_i|D_i=0] =$$ 
 $$E[Y_{1i}|D_i=1] - E[Y_{0i}|D_i=1] + $$
 $$E[Y_{0i}|D_i=1] - E[Y_{0i}|D_i=0]$$
